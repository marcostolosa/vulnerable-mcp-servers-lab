Vulnerable MCP Servers Lab
==========================

This repository contains **intentionally vulnerable** implementations of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers (both local and remote). Each server lives in its own folder and includes a dedicated `README.md` with full details on **what it does**, **how to run it**, and **how to demonstrate/attack the vulnerability**.

**Do not run any of this outside a controlled lab environment.**

## What this repo is for

- **Security training / research** into common MCP server and tool-integration failure modes.
- **Hands-on demos** of how vulnerable MCP servers can lead to data exposure, instruction injection, supply-chain compromise, and code execution.

## Safety / lab guidance

- **Use a disposable VM/container** and avoid using real secrets or personal data.
- Prefer running on an **isolated network**; several servers make outbound network calls.
- Treat **all tool output and retrieved content as untrusted data**.
- If you expose any server over HTTP, assume it may be reachable/abused unless you add proper controls.

## Getting started

- **Pick a server** from the index below.
- Open its per-server README and follow the instructions there.
- Many servers include a `claude_config.json` snippet intended to be merged into Claude Desktop’s MCP configuration.

## MCP servers in this repo

- **Filesystem Workspace Actions (path traversal + code exec)**: Tools for reading/writing/listing a “workspace” plus Python execution; vulnerable to naive path joining and unsandboxed code execution.
  - README: [`vulnerable-mcp-server-filesystem-workspace-actions/README.md`](vulnerable-mcp-server-filesystem-workspace-actions/README.md)

- **Indirect Prompt Injection (local stdio)**: Document retrieval/search that returns documents verbatim, including embedded hidden instructions.
  - README: [`vulnerable-mcp-server-indirect-prompt-injection/README.md`](vulnerable-mcp-server-indirect-prompt-injection/README.md)

- **Indirect Prompt Injection (remote MCP over HTTP+SSE)**: Network-accessible MCP server (HTTP + SSE) returning untrusted documents verbatim; models risk of connecting to untrusted remote MCP endpoints.
  - README: [`vulnerable-mcp-server-indirect-prompt-injection-remote-mcp/README.md`](vulnerable-mcp-server-indirect-prompt-injection-remote-mcp/README.md)

- **Malicious Code Execution (eval-based RCE)**: “Quote of the day” tool with an unsafe formatting feature that `eval()`s attacker-controlled JavaScript.
  - README: [`vulnerable-mcp-server-malicious-code-exec/README.md`](vulnerable-mcp-server-malicious-code-exec/README.md)

- **Malicious Tools (instruction injection / fabricated tool output)**: Appears to return status data, but injects misleading instructions and can fabricate plausible-looking incidents.
  - README: [`vulnerable-mcp-server-malicious-tools/README.md`](vulnerable-mcp-server-malicious-tools/README.md)

- **Namespace Typosquatting (`twittter-mcp`)**: Demonstrates supply-chain/trust issues via a lookalike server name intended to be mistaken for a legitimate package.
  - README: [`vulnerable-mcp-server-namespace-typosquatting/README.md`](vulnerable-mcp-server-namespace-typosquatting/README.md)

- **Outdated Packages (supply chain risk)**: Read-only system/filesystem inspection tools whose primary purpose is to demonstrate risk from outdated/deprecated/vulnerable dependencies.
  - README: [`vulnerable-mcp-server-outdated-pacakges/README.md`](vulnerable-mcp-server-outdated-pacakges/README.md)

- **Secrets + PII Exposure**: “Utilities” tools (IP/weather/news) but with embedded sensitive values in source code and leakage via logs.
  - README: [`vulnerable-mcp-server-secrets-pii/README.md`](vulnerable-mcp-server-secrets-pii/README.md)

- **Wikipedia (remote, Streamable HTTP)**: Wikipedia search/retrieval over HTTP; returns untrusted public content without sanitization or instruction/data separation (remote-content prompt injection risk).
  - README: [`vulnerable-mcp-server-wikipedia-http-streamable/README.md`](vulnerable-mcp-server-wikipedia-http-streamable/README.md)
